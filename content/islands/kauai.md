Kauai is breath-takingly gorgeous. It's covered in thick, jungle-like vegetation from the tops of the mountains to the ground.

My wife and I couldn't believe the views as we drove around the island.

Kauai feels very low-key and underdeveloped which adds to the wonderful experience. 

## Hiking

The hiking is fun, but you want to make sure you're in good shape. 

## Beaches

The current around Kauai is incredibly strong, and may be very dangerous.

There are some safe areas to get into the water, but I wouldn't recommend going here if you planned on a lot of water sports.
