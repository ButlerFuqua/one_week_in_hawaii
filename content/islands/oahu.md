Oahu is the island with Honolulu and Pearl Harbor on it. It's where I believe most people think of when they think of Hawai'i.

## Diversity

Oahu is incredibly diverse. Not only with people, but in terrain as well.

## Activities

At the time of writing this, Oahu is the only island that this site has [available to search](/oahu).

No bias here, but Oahu is where I'm currently living. A lot of this website is from my own experience and perspective.

## What to do

There is SO much to do in Oahu. Nearly any adventurous bucket list item may be checked off here.

The best way to find out what to do on Oahu is to [search for it](/oahu)!
