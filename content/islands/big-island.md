This island confused me at first because its name is "Hawai'i," and the state is also named Hawai'i. 

It's nickname is **"The Big Island,"** and that's what most locals refer to it as.

Just know that if you're booking an excursion and they claim to be on the "Island of Hawai'i," or in "Hawai'i" that it may be talking about the state ( *any of the islands* ), or it may be talking about **The Big Island**.

The best way to check if your on the right island is search your destination on Maps and see which island it's on.

The Big Island is known to be much more rural and affordable compared to [Oahu](/content/islands/oahu.md).

### Volcanoes

The [Hawai'i Volcano National Park](https://www.nps.gov/havo/index.htm) is located on The Big Island.
