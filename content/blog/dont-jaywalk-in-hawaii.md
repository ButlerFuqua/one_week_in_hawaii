I know jaywalking doesn't seem to be enforced nearly anywhere else in the U.S., but that's not always the case in Hawai'i.

## Oahu

It might be different on the other islands, but people are often ticketed for Jaywalking in Honolulu.

Especially in Waikiki.

## It's like speeding

Yes, you'll see lots of people jaywalking in Honolulu, but I still don't advise it.

Think of jaywalking in Oahu like speeding in a speed trap. You might get away with it in most places, but you don't do it in an area where you know cops are waiting to ticket you. 

You don't want to be the one that gets hurt or gets caught.
