I know jaywalking doesn't seem to be enforced nearly anywhere else in America, but that may not be the case in Hawai'i.

## Oahu

This might not be the case on the other islands, but people are often ticketed for Jaywalking in Honolulu.

I've witness this mostly enforced in Waikiki.

## It's like speeding

Yes, you'll see lots of people jaywalking in Waikiki, but I still don't advise it.

Think of jaywalking in Oahu like speeding in a speed trap. You might get away with it most places, or if no one sees you, but you don't do it in an area you know cops are watching closely. 


You don't want to be the one that gets hurt or gets caught.
