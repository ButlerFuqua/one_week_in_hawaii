## Where?

Lani Kai is located in Kailua, right past [Kailua Beach park](kailua-beach-park). ( *Click above link to view in Google Maps* ).

## What's it like?

### Views

In my opinion, this is one of the most beautiful beaches on Oahu. The sand is soft and bright, and the views are incredible. 

Behind the beach is a quiet, residential neighborhood with just enough mountains for some great scenery.

In the water are twin mountains called "The Mokes."

### Sand

The sand is among the softest that I've seen on the island.

## What to do in Lani Kai

### Chill

My wife and I like to go here when we feel like just chilling on the beach and going for a good swim. 

### Snorkel

Sometimes it's great for snorkeling, but the water is often choppy which makes the underwater visibility not so great.

There is a decent amount of coral in the water. This makes it great for snorkeling.

### Kite surfing (no so often)

I sometimes see locals kite surfing here, but there's way more of that at [Kailua Beach park](kailua-beach-park).

## Parking

Parking isn't *too* bad here. The only parking is in the residential neighborhood directly behind the beach. 

My wife and I usually find a spot relatively easily, but there have been some limitations recently.

**At the time of writing this** parking has been restricted to locals residents M-F during certain hours. But, as you can see in the photo, this is only through December 11, 2021. However, this may continue longer due to Emergency vehicles not being able to get through the crowded streets.

My advice, just be ready to park at Kailua beach Park and walk to Lani Kai if you can make the walk.
