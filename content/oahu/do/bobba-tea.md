> I'll get pictures next time I buy some bobba tea.

There are a few things I feel I should say up front.

* It's also called "bubble tea."
* It's definitely not exclusive to Hawai'i.
* You don't have to get tea. For example, you can get a smoothie or juice.

## What is it?

Bobba tea is one of my favorite treats on the island. I've gone through phases of getting it nearly every day.

It's a cold drink, usually milk tea, that has tapioca balls ( known as "bobba" ) in it.

The drink is served with a wide straw that's big enough for the bobba to go through.

Drinking bobba tea is kind of a strange sensation if you aren't used to it. Bobba is just a bit smaller than marbles, so you definitely feel it.

### Other options

You can get the bobba in nearly any type of drink. Some places serve smoothies or juice with bobba in it.

## Where to find bobba tea

My favorite place to get bobba tea from is "Coffee or Tea?"

> I realize at the time of writing this that Coffee or Tea is the only place I've gotten bobba tea from so far. It's obviously good enough to keep me loyal.

There are two "Coffee or Tea?" locations on Oahu. One is [in Honolulu](https://goo.gl/maps/Z8ccqgQxiD1sXCEe7), and the other is [in Kailua](https://g.page/cotkailua?share).

They're both pretty much the same experience.

If you want to try something different, then simply pull up Maps on your phone and search for "bobba tea" or "bubble tea."

Lots of places serve it, and they always proudly advertise it since it's so popular.

## My flavor recommendations

My go-to is Taro milk tea, but I'll get a Honeydew milk tea when I want something sweeter ( the honeydue is very sweet ).

I also recently tried the Tiger Sugar Tea and it's really good. However, I'm not sure if it's just a temporary promotion at Coffee or Tea or not.
