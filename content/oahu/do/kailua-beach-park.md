## Where?

Kailua Beach park is right past the town of Kailua.

> I plan on going back and getting some more pictures. I was in a hurry when I got these.

## What's it like?

</div>

Half park area, and have beach area. Great for the whole family. It's usually very windy.

### Park area

What I call the "Park area" is the grassy area that includes picnic tables, a walkway, and plenty of space to walk around and let the kids play.

</div>

As you can see by the above picture, the park is full of trees and quite beautiful. The grassy part of the park is large and beautiful enough to stand on it's own, so it's great if you're looking for that kind of experience.

> I don't know if it communicates in the pictures, but the park and beach area are both pretty big.

### Beach area

</div>

The beach is quite large with plenty of room for activities.

I think the walk up to the beach is really neat the way the small hills start turning from grassy null to sandy beach.

### Kids

There are some natural pools of ocean water where it's great for toddlers and kids to play in. My wife and I love talking our toddler here. 

> I'll get a pictures of these next time I go.

## Places to eat

</div>

There's a nice restaurant right across from the park.

In addition to that, Kailua town is very close and there are plenty of options there.

**Heads up**, smaller restaurants here like bistros, crepe shops, and anything that serves only breakfast and brunch close in the early afternoon.

## What to do in Kailua Beach Park

There's plenty of space in the sand to setup for a full on beach day party. 

The parking is close, so this is one of the easier beaches to bring lots of equipment to.

### Kite & wind surfing 

I almost always see the locals kite or wind surfing here. 

It makes sense because there's plenty of room for setting up, and it's always pretty windy.

### Swim to the Flats

There's a small, flat island right across from the sand. 

> Again, I'll get a picture  next time I go.

It's just far enough to be a challenge for someone to swim to, but probably not too bad to kayak to.

## Parking

This park has pretty solid free parking. I still get the same "Hope we find a spot" anxiety that typically accompanies city parks, but we always find a decent spot.
