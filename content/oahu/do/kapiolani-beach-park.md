</div>

This beach park has multiple grassy areas and a smaller sandy beach. One of the best things -The parking is free!

My wife and I often park here when we're going to Waikiki. It's a bit more of a walk, but it's not too bad.

### Grassy areas

There are multiple grassy areas, but the one by the beach seems to be the most popular.

The park offers picnic tables, beautiful trees, and plenty of space to lounge or run around.

It's not uncommon to see fitness or yoga groups in the morning.

### Beach area

The beach area is kinda slim in my opinion, but it's very nice. Plus the showers and bathrooms are nearby.


### Water

</div>

The water is usually calm enough to swimming and relaxing.

### Sand

The sand is somewhat course, and the bank into the ocean is kind of steep. However, there is enough flat areas to post a beach towel and relax.
